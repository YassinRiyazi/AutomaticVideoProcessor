    Description: This script detects drops in images by analyzing pixel intensity changes.

    Caution:
        Code will fail if there are more than one drop in the image.
        Images should have exactly 5 rows of black pixels at the bottom of the image.
        It works with tilted setup drop images, on other drop shape it is untested.
        It intended for leveled images, and not tested on normal images.
        If a smudge hit a drop, result are untested. 


    To make code versatile, normalize based on the number of height pixels with maximum brightness./ otherwise overflow may occur.
            I failed, I don't know how does it generate 130000 from summing pixels.
            And it is really costly to cast float to int.

        Add timing decorator:

                [detection] Avg peak memory usage: 158.18 KiB

            - Optimize image resizing and processing time.

            - Check effect of transposing on performance.

                    [detection] Avg peak memory usage: 158.18 KiB
                !!! If is more damaging than transpose, because it is not optimized for numpy arrays.
                !!! And probably inside numpy transpose happens for calculating the sum.
    Code execution is 480 microseconds.

    Crops all images for a single experiment folder and saves crop info to CSV.

    Caution: 
        Adaptive approach to detect drops in images.
        In this function width of the detected drop should be around 300 pixels or 115% of the image width. other wise the steep value will be adjusted to 0.005 from 0.0025. Some time a small drop in the end of slide can be sitting and that is enough to cause problems in the detection. We end up with a really wide image.

    args:
        experiment (str): Path to the experiment folder containing images.
        SaveAddress (str): Optional path to save cropped images.
        SaveAddressCSV (str): Optional path to save CSV file with crop info.
        extension (str): File extension of images to process (default: '.png').
        scaleDownFactor_x (int): Factor to scale down the images for processing.
        drop_width (int): Initial width of the drop to be detected. According to my experiment it is usually 150 in beginning and goes up to 450 for drops with surfactant.
        tolerance_width (float): Tolerance width for drop detection (default: 1.13).
        _morphologyEx (bool): Whether to apply morphologyEx operation on the image (default: False).

    raises:
        ValueError: If no images are found in the experiment folder.
        ValueError: If the crop coordinates are invalid.

    Example:
        >>> Main("path/to/experiment", "path/to/save/cropped_images", "path/to/save/csv", extension='.png', scaleDownFactor_x=5, drop_width=300, tolerance_width=1.13)
